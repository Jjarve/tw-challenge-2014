        <h4>However, we think QuickTransfer&trade; might be of interest to you.</h4>
        <p>We use a very simple method to allow transactions happen without the sender knowing complicated information about the recepient.</p>
        <h4>How do we do it?</h4>
        <p>We connect you with others by their e-mail address or mobile number and let <b>them</b> enter their banking details. </p>
        <p>That way you can pay for your late night taxi drives or weekend beers without hassle.</p>
